# Argon
This Go library provides a simple and efficient way to generate **Argon2id hashes**, which are widely recognized for their security and performance. The library offers flexibility with configurable parameters for **salt length**, **number of iterations**, **memory usage**, **number of threads**, and **key length**.

Key features include:

- Generation of a random salt of a specified length.
- Generation of an Argon2id hash using a provided salt.
- Generation of an Argon2id hash along with a random salt.
This library is ideal for any Go project that requires secure password hashing.
